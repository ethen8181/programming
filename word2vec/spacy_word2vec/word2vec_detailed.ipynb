    "At a high level `Word2Vec` is a unsupervised learning algorithm that uses a shallow neural network (with one hidden layer) to learn the vectorial representations of all the unique words/phrases for a given corpus. The advantage that word2vec offers is it tries to preserve the semantic meaning behind those terms. For example, a document may employ the words \"dog\" and \"canine\" to mean the same thing, but never use them together in a sentence. Ideally, the word2vec algorithm would be able to learn the context and place them together in similar vector semantic space.\n",

In addition, there’s not enough data to make any meaningful training on those words, so it’s best to ignore them. A reasonable value for min_count is between 0-100, depending on the size of the dataset.\n",

The word2vec framework we introduced here is skip-gram, where we're using the target word to predict the context word, where CBow is simply flipping it the other way around, i.e. using the context word to predict the target word.

    "Word2Vec and the concept of word embeddings originated in the domain of NLP, however the idea of words in the context of a sentence or a surrounding word window can be generalized to other problem domain dealing with sequences or sets of related data points. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A direct application of Word2Vec to a classical engineering task was recently presented by Spotify. They abstracted the ideas behind Word2Vec to apply them not simply to words in sentences but to any object in any sequence, in this case to songs in a playlist. Songs are treated as words and other songs in a playlist as their surrounding context, depending on whether the playlists in question were genre specific the vocabulary encompassed a number of songs from that collection. Now in order to recommend songs to a user one merely has to examine a neighborhood of the 'song embeddings' of songs the user already likes\n",
    "- Similarly, we could recommend a user who to connect to in a social network setting by examining the graph of relationships, where the nodes represent words and a path through the graph represents a sentence, then nodes that occur in the context of similar other nodes, would be close together in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show that the general applicability of Word2Vec based algorithms is very rich and that it behooves practitioners to examine their problem domain with respect to sequences of objects that occur in some meaningful context."
