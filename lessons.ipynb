In the recent advancements in deep learning, this is often coined as self-supervised or semi-supervised learning."

    "When building a machine learning system, there's always the offline and the online experimentation part. We typically start with an initial hypothesis, build a model and pick a metric to evaluate offline. After validating our hypothesis offline, we then deploy it as an A/B test online to test the hypothesis in real world settings. Some times, the offline metric and online metric might not correlate with each other, and we would need to figure out why. e.g. One of the potential reasons could be the discrepancy in the online serving code and offline training code. If the deployment code and training code are written by different people/teams then there could be a situation where the feature engineering steps are handled differently in the two pipelines."
