       "'WASHINGTON  —   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration’s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trump’s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. “Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,” said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. “Upon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ” In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer’s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they “and the  ’s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  ’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. ” The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will “provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ” Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of “cascading effects” if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ’s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case “will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation’s health insurance and health care systems generally. ” No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  —   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  —   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  —   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.'"

according standard growth theory ongoing increase size government ought exert downward pressure rates growth dont see expected effect data national growth trends amazingly stable look family advanced liberal democratic countries countries spend smaller portion national income social transfer programs gain little terms growth relative countries spend much lavishly social programs peter lindert economist university california davis, calls ”free lunch paradox.” lindert’s label puzzle somewhat misleading, big expensive welfare states are, obviously, expensive. come expense growth. standard economic theory isn’t completely wrong. it’s democracies embraced generous social spending found ways afford minimizing offsetting effects. you’re careful numbers, fact find small negative effect social welfare spending growth. still, according economic theory, lunch ought really expensive. it’s not. three main reasons big welfare states don’t hurt growth much might think. first, lindert emphasized, tend efficient tax systems minimize market distortions. tax something, people tend avoid it. tax income, united states does, people work little less, means certain economic gains never materialize, leaving everyone little poorer. taxing consumption, many european peers do, less likely discourage productive moneymaking, though discourage spending. that’s bad. less consumption means savings, savings puts capital capitalism, financing economic activity creates growth. advantages, too. consumption taxes usually structured national sales taxes (or vats, taxes) paid small amounts continuous basis, extremely cheap collect (and hard avoid) less income taxes, mitigates counterproductively demoralizing aspect taxation. big welfare states also likely tax addictive stuff, people tend buy whatever price, well unhealthy polluting stuff. harnesses otherwise fiscally behavior minimize costs health care environmental damage. second, transfer programs relatively direct effects. workers productive jobs training experience, example, unemployment benefits offer displaced workers time find good, fit. there’s also evidence health care benefits aren’t linked employment promote economic entrepreneurship. fans redistributive programs tend oversell kind upside growth, really some. moreover, makes sense countries devoted programs would time amplify aspects. can’t assume government spending affects growth way. composition spending — well cuts spending — matters. cuts spending hurt growth much help. really hurt increase economic anxiety generate demand economic policy. third, lots regulatory state policies hurt growth by, say, impeding healthy competition closing foreign trade, like high levels redistribution better like policies, you’ll eventually consider getting rid them. get rid them, economic freedom score heritage foundation fraser institute goes up. sort compensatory economic liberalization big welfare states indirectly promote growth, less explains countries like canada, denmark, sweden become robustly capitalist past several decades. needed better capitalists afford socialism. works pretty well. bundle together fiscal efficiency, offsetting effects, compensatory liberalization, wind big government, high levels social welfare spending little negative consequences growth. call ” .” missing political genuine reform enthusiasts small government ready reply. fine, they’ll say. big government work policies offset drag growth. less intrusive regulatory state smaller redistributive state: . all, formula hong kong singapore, rank no. 1 no. 2 economic freedom. clearly that’s best bet economic freedom. argument ignores two things. first, hong kong singapore authoritarian technocracies, liberal democracies, suggests (though doesn’t prove) special recipe requires nondemocratic government work. bring democracy picture, important political lesson canadian danish rise economic freedom becomes clear: democratically popular welfare programs become politically nonnegotiable fixed points, come exert intense pressure fiscal economic policy make sustainable. political demand economic liberalization come somewhere. there’s generally little organic, popular democratic appetite capitalist creative destruction. constant ”disruption” scary, way markets generate wealth hard comprehend, many us find competitive intuitively objectionable. it’s danes swedes canadians ever loved ”neoliberal” market reforms. fought bitterly rolled back. welfare states creaking weight, enough public willing, thanks sense economic security provided welfare state, listen experts warned redistributive state would become unsustainable without downsizing regulatory state. sound generous system social insurance offers certain peace mind makes real risks increased economic dynamism seem tolerable democratic public, opening political possibility stabilizing welfare state economic liberalization. sense baseline economic security precisely many millions americans lack. learning lesson donald trump america’s declining economic freedom profoundly serious problem. it’s already putting brakes dynamism growth, leaving millions americans bitter sense panic prospects. demand answers. ordinary voters aren’t policy wonks. gripped economic anxiety, turn demagogues promise measures make intuitive economic sense, actually make economic problems worse. may dodge trump presidency time, fail fix feedback loop declining economic freedom increasingly acute sense economic anxiety, risk plunging world’s biggest economy linchpin global stability political economic death spiral. it’s ridiculous understatement say it’s important doesn’t happen. republicans libertarians need stare hard framed picture donald trump reflect idea stale economic agenda focused cutting taxes slashing government spending unlikely deliver gains. instead likely continue backfire exacerbating economic anxiety public’s sense system rigged. gaze donald long enough, fascist lips whisper ”thank you,” explain close confusing identification fiscal orthodoxy ”free market” economic policy helps authoritarian populists like — hurts political
