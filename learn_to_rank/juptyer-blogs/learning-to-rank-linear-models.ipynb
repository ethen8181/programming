    "Many search nerds get an instinct they want to \"learn the right boosts\" to apply to their queries. Search often feels like whack-a-mole, and often folks say \"if I could just optimize the boost on say the 'title match' vs the boost on the 'body match' I'd be in great shape!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This instinct of learning what boost to apply to queries is the instinct behind the simplest [learning to rank](http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/24/what-is-learning-to-rank/) model: the linear model. Yes! Good ole linear regression! What's nice about linear regression is that, well, it doesn't really *feel* like machine learning. It feels like high school statistics. It's very easy to understand the model and make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of articles, I want to begin to introduce the key algorithms behind successful learning to rank implementations, starting with linear regression and working up to topics like gradient boosting (different kinda boosting alltogether), RankSVM, and random forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning to Rank as a Regression Problem\n",
    "For this series of articles, I want to map learning to rank, as you might be familiar from [previous articles](http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/24/what-is-learning-to-rank/) and [documentation](https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank#building-a-learning-to-rank-system-with-elasticsearch) to a more general problem: regression. *Regression* trains a model to map a set of numerical features to a predicted numerical value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what if you wanted to be able to predict a company's profit? You might have, on hand, historical data about public corporations including number of employees, stock market price, revenue, cash on hand, etc. Given data you know about existing companies, your model could be trained to predict profit as a function of these variables (or a subset thereof). For a new company you could use your function to arrive at a prediction of the company's profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just the same, learning to rank can be a regression problem. You have on hand a series of *judgments* that grade how relevant a document is for a query. Our relevance grades could range from A to F. More commonly they range from 0 (not at all relevant) to 4 (exactly relevant). If we just consider a keyword search to be a query, this become, as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    grade,movie,keywordquery\n",
    "    4,Rocky,rocky\n",
    "    0,Turner and Hootch,rocky\n",
    "    3,Rocky II,rocky\n",
    "    1,Rambo,rocky\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Learning to Rank becomes a regression problem when you build a model to predict the *grade* as a function of ranking-time *signals.* Recall from [Relevant Search](http://manning.com/books/relevant-search) we term signals to mean any measurement about the relationship between the query and a document. These are often more generically called *features*, but I prefer the term *signals*. One reason is that signals are typically *query-dependent* - that is they result by taking some measurement of how a keyword (or other part of the query) relates to the document. Some measurement of their relationship. Yet we can take other signals, including ones that are query-only or document-only, such as publication date of an article, or some entity extraction run on the query (like \"company names\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the movie example above. You might have 2 query-dependent signals you suspect could help predict relevance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many times a search keyword occurs in the **title** field\n",
    "2. How many times a search keyword occurs in the **overview** field\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmenting the *judgments* above, you might arrive at a training set for regression like below in CSV, mapping grades to signal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    grade,numTitleMatches,numOverviewMatches\n",
    "    4,1,1\n",
    "    0,0,0\n",
    "    3,0,3\n",
    "    1,0,1\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can apply a regression process such as linear regression, to predict the first column using the other columns. You can build such a system on top of an existing search engine like [Solr](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Learning+To+Rank) or [Elasticsearch](http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/14/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sidestepping a complicated question. Specifically: how do you arrive at these judgments? How do you know when a document was good or bad for a query? Interpreting user analytics? Manually with experts? This often is the hardest problem to solve -- and can be quite domain specific! Coming up with supposed data to create a model is fine and dandy, but garbage in, garbage out! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression for Learning to Rank\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've learned any statistics, you're probably familiar with Linear Regression. *Linear Regression* defines the regression problem as a simple linear function. For example, if in learning to rank we called the first signal above (how many times a search keyword occurs it the **title** field) as `t` and the second signal above (the same for the **overview** field) as `o`, our model might be able to generate a function `s` to score our relevance as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    s(t, o) = c0 + c1 * t + c2 * o\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the best fit coefficients `c0, c1, c2...` that predict our training data using a procedure known as [least squares fitting](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html). We won't cover that here, but the gist is we can find the `c0, c1, c2, ...` that minimize the error between the actual grade, `g` and the prediction `s(t,o)`. It's often as simple as a little [matrix math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) if you want to bone up on your linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get fancier with linear regression, including deciding there's really a third ranking signal, `a` which we can define as `t*o`. Or another signal called `t2`, which could be in reality `t^2` or `log(t)` or whatever formulation you suspect could help best predict relevance. You can then just treat these values as additional columns in the dataset for which linear regression can learn coefficients for.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a deeper art to of designing, testing ,and evaluating models of any flavor, I heartily recommend [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) if you'd like to learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning to Rank with Linear Regression in sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a taste, Python's [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) family of libraries is a convenient way to play with regression. If we want to try out the simple learning to rank training set above for linear regression, we can express the relevance grade's we're trying to predict as `S`, and the signals we feel will predict that score as `X`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to have some fun with some movie relevance data. Here we have a set of relevance grades for a keyword search \"Rocky.\" Recall above we had a judgment list that we transformed into a training set. Let's take a gander at a real training set (w/ comments to help us see what's going on). The three ranking signals we'll be examining include the title TF\\*IDF score, the overview TF\\*IDF score and the movie's user rating.\n",
