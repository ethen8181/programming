    "- **Reproducibility:** \"It works on my machine\". Reproducing other people's work can be surprisingly hard. It might not matter that much if we're writing scripts that we are going to throw away anyway, but as a professional data scientist, it is important that we ensure our work is reproducible. Reproducibility not only facilitates peer review, but ensures the model, application or analysis we build can run and withstand the test of time. Before, when developing a model in python, we might do a `pip freeze` and add the resulting `requirements.txt` file as part of the project, but this might still cause issues as this only encapsulates python specific dependencies, whereas there are often times dependencies that lives outside python such as operating system, compilers, drivers, etc. that are required for our code to run successfully. And wrapping everything in a Docker container reduces the burden on others trying to recreate the environment and makes our work more accessible."
