    "**Inverse Probability/Propensity of Treatment Weighting** is another method for estimating casual effects. Rather than doing matching, we could use all of the data, but down-weight some and up-weight the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, we'll focus on the situation where there's just a single binary confounded that we'll call $X$. Let's also imagine that among people who have this confounder value equal to $1$. So, $X = 1$. The probability of treatment is equal to 0.1. i.e. the propensity score for people with $X = 1$ is equal to $0.1$. Now let's look at the other group of people, these are individuals who have $X = 0$. Here the probability of treatment is equal to $0.8$. Hence, in our scenario, people with $X = 1$ will unlikely to receive the treatment, 10% chance, where as people with $X = 0$ are very likely to receive it, 80% chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to do propensity score matching on the $X = 1$ group, we would match 1 treated subject with a randomly selected control subject (it's randomly selected because with a propensity score of 0.1, for every 1 treated subject we would have 9 control subject). So rather than matching, where we're discarding some of our data, we could use all of the data, but down-weight some and up-weight others. In this case, what we could do this up-weight the treated subject 9 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual implementation of this idea is essentially what's called inverse propensity weighting. Where for treated subject, we would weight it by the inverse of $P(A=1|X)$, i.e. the probability of receiving the treatment and for control subject, we would weight by the inverse of $P(A=0|X)$. Hence in our $X=1$ example, each treated and control subject would receive a weight of $1/0.1$ and $1/0.9$ respectively. So even though there might be more control subject than the treated subject, after applying the weighting, the effective amount of data in our downstream analysis is now equal."
