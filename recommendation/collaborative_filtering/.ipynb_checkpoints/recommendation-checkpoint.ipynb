    "# Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this documentation, we will create a recommendation system for **restaurants** using [collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (CF). The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items. CF thus relies on users' past behavior to make recommendations to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary approaches to CF: neighboorhood and latent factor model. The former is concerned with computing the relationships between items or between users. In the latter approach you have a model of hidden factors through which users and items are transformed to the same space. For example, if you are rating movies we may transform items into genre factors, and users into their preference for a particular genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor models generally lead to more accurate recommenders. One of the reasons for this is the sparsity of the item-user matrix. Most users tend to rate barely one or two items. Latent factor models are more expressive, and fit fewer parameters. However, neighborhood models are more prevalent, as they have an intuitive aspect that appeals to users(if you liked this you will like that) and online(a new preference can be incorporated very quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most recommenders today combine neighboorhood CF with model based CF, and SVD based matrix factorization approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the example of a simple beer recommender, go [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/20a18d52c539b87de2af). This homework is inspired by the one there but we go after food instead, and go deeper into the problem of making recommendations."

    "## Our Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate our recommendation system, consider the follwing example. Let's pretend we are in Boston for a second. Lets say the average rating of restaurants here by all the users is 3.5. Sandrine's at Harvard square is better than an average restaurant, so it tends to be rated 0.5 stars above the average (over all the users). However, you are a curmudgeon, who tends to rate 0.2 stars below the average. Then a baseline estimate for the recommendation for Sandrine's, for you, is 3.5+0.5-0.2=3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "These baseline estimates thus adjust the data by accounting for the systematic tendencies for some users who give higher ratings than others, and for some restaurants to recieve higher ratings than others. We can write the baseline estimate $\\hat Y_{um}^{baseline}$ for an unknown rating $Y_{um}$ for user $u$ and restaurant or business $m$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat Y_{um}^{baseline} = \\hat \\mu + \\hat \\theta_{u0} + \\hat \\gamma_{m0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the unknown parameters $\\theta_{u0}$ and $\\gamma_{m0}$ indicate the deviations, or biases, of user $u$ and item $m$, respectively, from some intercept parameter $\\mu$. (The reason for the strange notation with 0s will become clear in Problem 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the $\\theta_{u0}$ and $\\gamma_{m0}$ are parameters which need to be fit. The simplest thing to start with, and something we will do for Problems 1 and 2 (but not 3), is to replace them by their \"mean\" estimates from the data. Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat Y^{baseline}_{um} = \\bar Y + (\\bar Y_u - \\bar Y) + (\\bar Y_m - \\bar Y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar Y_u$ = `user_avg`, the average of all a user $u$'s ratings and $\\bar Y_m$ = `business_avg`, the average of all ratings for a restaurant $m$. $\\bar Y$ is the average rating over all reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final two terms correspond to the user-specific and item-specific bias in ratings, that is, how their ratings tend to systematically diverge from the global average. This is the simplest possible way to predict a rating, based only on information about *this* user and *this* restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do a better job of predicting the rating $Y_{um}$ user $u$ would give to restaurant $r$? According to the central dogma of CF, we ought to be able to use the responses of *similar* users regarding *similar* restaurants to get a better prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make an estimate of $Y_{um}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{Y_{um}} = \\hat Y_{um}^{baseline}\\, + \\,\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m)} s_{mj} ( Y_{uj} - \\hat Y_{uj}^{baseline} )}{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m)} s_{mj} } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s^{k}(m)$ is the $k$ neighbor items of item $m$ based on some pooling criterion, for example, those items which have been rated by user $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two problems, we will focus on using similar restaurants, or the item neighborhood.\n",
    "To do this, we compute a *similarity measure* $s_{mj}$ between the $m$th and $j$th items. This similarity might be measured via [cosine similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), [pearson co-efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) or using other distance based measures. Here we shall use the Pearson coefficient. This measures the tendency of users to rate items similarly. Since most ratings are unknown, it is computed on the \"common user support\" (`n_common`), which is the set of common raters of both items. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first problem we shall set $S$ to the global neighborhood of the item, and in the second we shall set it to those items which have been rated by user $u$."

    "\n",
    "Now we have a way to pool information between similar restaurants to try to predict a user's recommendation. But how do we choose the neighborhood to pool over? We begin with the simplest choice. We calculate the similarity between items using their entire common user support, and rank the nearest neighbors of an item by this similarity. We call this a \"global\" recommender because it assumes that every user perceives the similarity between restaurants in the same way. Later on, we will implement a more specific recommender that pools information based on which items seem the most similar *to this user*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global recommender does have the advantage of dealing with the possible sparsity of the user's rated items, but also the disadvantage of giving one answer for all users, without taking the user's preferences into account. This is a classic case of bias-variance tradeoff.\n",

    "\n",
    "We now move to calculating a global database of pairwise restaurant similarities, which is to create a database of the similarities for each pair of restaurants. The class `Database` is initialized in its constructor by taking a dataframe of reviews as its arguments. The method `recommender` iterates over every possible pair of business_ids in the dataframe and calculates the database with similarities and common supports. \n",

    "Even though each reviewer uses the same 5-star scale when rating restaurants, comparing two users by comparing their raw user ratings can be problematic. Consider a user whose average rating is 2. This is a curmudgeonly user. Consider another whose average rating is 4. This is a rather enthusiastic one. How should we compare a 3 rating by the curmudgeonly one to a 5 rating of the enthusiastic one?\n",

    "It is for this purpose that we must subtract the average rating of the user from the actual rating of the restaurants in computing the similarity of two restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no common support (`n_common=0`), we have no basis for making a similarity estimate, and so we set the similarity to 0. In the case that the individual restaurant rating variance is 0, such as in the case where there is only one common reviewer (`n_common=1`), we return the `NaN` that the scipy `pearsonr` returns and also converts it to 0."

    "Consider the two cases where there is just one common reviewer, and where there are 40. In the former case, we might get a artificially high similarity based on the tastes of just this user, and thus we must reduce its importance in the nearest-neighbor calculation. In the latter case, we would get a much more unbiased estimator of the similarity of the two restaurants.\n",

    "Recall the notions of regularization introduced in class. We want to reduce the variance in our estimates, so we pull our estimates in toward a conservative point in a way that strongly corrals in estimates when there is very little data, but allows the data to speak when there is a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good value of the regularizer is intuitively one that doesn't affect the similarity when the common support is high ~10, but has a large effect when the support is small. In this case, values of 2-4 are good. Usually, the value of `reg` is determined using cross-validation, but for the sake of simplicity we will generally set it to 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, it is hard to judge if the above recommendations are any good. In the usual testing paradigm, say that we break the dataframe into train and test. Based on the training set, I am recommended restaurant B. Now, I have rated B, but that information is in the testing set. I have no way of comparing the rating I give B in the testing set, to the similarity computed from the training set that was used to make the recomendation. The best I could do is to compare the average rating of restaurant B in the training set to my rating of restaurant B in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we shift our focus to more fine-grained predictions about each user, and try to predict what _rating_ a user would give to a restaurant they have never tried before. To do this, we will try to personalize the information we use even further, and only pool information from restaurants that the user has rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to return to the original problem of prediction $Y_{um}$ for a restaurant $m$ that user $u$ has never rated before. Using our newly computed similarity metrics, we can modify our original baseline estimate by pulling in information from the user's neighborhood of the restaurant $m$, and predict $Y_{um}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{Y_{um}} = \\hat Y^{baseline}_{um}\\, + \\,\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m;u)} s_{mj} ( Y_{uj} - \\hat Y^{baseline}_{uj} )}{\\sum\\limits_{j \\in S^{k}(m;u)} s_{mj} } $$\n",

However, one must start somewhere!\n",

    "\n",
    "The predicted ratings are lower because these are Vern's top 5 choices, which represent the largest positive deviations away from Vern's mean rating of 3.57. Because we are looking at the upper tail of Vern's rating distribution, but pooling information together from the K nearest neighbors among Vern's rated restaurants to construct the predicted rating, the predicted ratings should fall closer to Vern's user mean than the true ones do. Taking into account the average restaurant rating helps a little bit here because we can adjust the predicted rating to reflect an overall very good restaurant, but it does not counteract the effect of looking at the upper tail of Vern's ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we were to take Vern's bottom 5 restaurants, we would see the opposite effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the larger K is (assuming that the similarities within this neighborhood are positive), the closer the predicted rating will be to Vern's user average (this is the bias limit in the bias-variance tradeoff). Similarly, the smaller K is, the more likely we are to have user ratings that are close to the observed rating (the variance limit). The sparsity of the data affects how quickly we move from the variance limit to the bias limit as we increase K. If there were a lot of very similar restaurants in the dataset that Vern had ranked very highly, even with K relatively large, it would be possible to see a predicted rating much closer to the extremely positive ratings we see here in Vern's top 5 (see the results in question 4.4). As these data are now, however, even the most similar 7 restaurants to these that Vern rated so highly lie closer to Vern's mean.\n",

Since the nearest neighbor models can have alternating positive and negative similarities (the sum of similarity weights in the denominator can get large), the ratings can get very large. Thus we restrict ourselves to be between -10 and 15 in our ratings and calculate the fraction within these bounds. We also plot the line with unit slope, line segments joining the means, and a filled in area representing one standard deviation from the mean.\n",
