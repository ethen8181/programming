Heroku is a web service that runs our code and allows other to access/interact it.
This process is called "hosting"

Apart from being able to host our application, it also enables SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
for us, meaning that the communication between the client and server (Heroku) will be encrypted.
This is useful when sending sensitive information such as password to ensure other people can't
snoop on that information.
